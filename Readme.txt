LaundryGo home page:


The first instance of motion graphics is the background bubbles: They are randomly generated using a javascript plugin that can be started and stopped by clicking on the “bubbles” button. 
The displayed text on the button then switches to start and stop after the first click.


The second usage of motion graphics is the rotation of the logo image on hover using a simple CSS transformation of 1080 degrees.  There is a transition of 2 seconds applied so to make the logo spin as if a washing machine was running.


The 3rd instance is seen when the user hovers over the bottom blue section: Using CSS, The waves and blue section move up by 75px to cover the (inactive) links to other pages within the site and the text grows to 20px for easier legibility. There is an ease-in-out transition to make the movement look more natural, as if the water levels are rising and falling.
